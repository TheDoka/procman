3. Cosumer beat world record overclocking for his 3900xt
   On hydrogen
   12 core chip
   3.8 base > 4.7 boost > 5.7GHz overclock
   He said thanks to covid, offering time to play around

4. WIFI 6 / 802.11ax not really new but
   Estimated four times faster than Wifi 5 (ac) thanks to two protocols
   1. OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access), divide channels when they are in use to prevent congestion
   2. Mu-MIMO (Multi-Utilisateur Multiple-Input Multiple-Output), allows all connected users to talk with router simultaniously
   Increased gain of 40% over wifi 5 allowing better reach
   Better battery life using tech TWT (Target Wake Time), wifi router would be able to tell if devices should be wake or not when not using network

5. Incoming Ryzen 4000 series  
   Greater speed
   Increased power efficiency

6. PCIe Gen 4
   PCIe gen 3.0 was 8GT/s
   PCie gen 4.0 is 16GT/s
   GT as Mega Transfer
   I don't know what's a MT represent, at least some idea of speed, but the idea is that it is twice faster as previous gen

7. Should you switch to X570/B550? Or stay with B450/X470/X490
   Supoport PCIe GEN 4, will be really cool in the future cf. 
   Expensive
   Not really worth right now, need to wait for GEN 4 extension
   Faster USB lanes, 2 USB 5gbs, 2 superspeed usb 10gbps but up to 4, 6 USB 480mbps 
   (B450 is 2x10gbps, 2x 5gbps, 6x 480mbps)
